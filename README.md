## Number Guesser project 1705 mod1 ##

Number Guesser is a single player game in which the user attempts to guess a randomly selected number.  Upon page load a random number is generated and stored for evaluation.  The user is prompted to input a range of numbers between 1 and 100.  Upon input of the low and high number range another random number will be generated pertaining to the user set parameters.  The user then will enter their "guess number" in the provided field.  Once a guess has been entered, the guess, clear and reset buttons become active.  The user can click the guess button to submit the guess, the clear button to clear the input field or the reset button to reset the game.  Upon guessing the computer will evaluate the guess against the random number and return a message "too low" if too low and "too high" if too high.  If the user guesses correctly "BOOM" will be displayed.  If guessed correctly a message will display informing the user that the range of numbers has decreased the low number and increased the high number each buy 10, the user is encouraged to guess again.
